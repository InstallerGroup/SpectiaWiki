**Notes from the sprint kick off:**
1. New structure for the sprint meetings was proposed
- **Kick off** with 2 parts: Part 1 - Focus on FE demo and retro (the whole team may join), Part II - Focus on planning and sprint goal definition (Henrik, Jim, Jakob, Mark and Claudia will join)
- **Stand up**: only those with active tasks are required to give an update with focus on blockers or meetings that should be arranged. If anyone else wants to share an update, they can do so in the end. The aim is to keep the stand up as short and effective as possible and focused on the  goal throughout the sprint. Design updates will be handled during the design/UX status every Thursday, so Lasse doesn't need to join the daily stand up unless there is a relevant occassion.

2. **Demo**: @<8B97FF89-47A0-6059-B559-DF1DE4378BF8> showed the sticky header in the invoice control. The chart library works fine for Mark, he only want's Lasse to check if we could use the colours that the whoesalers are referred to in the industry. Lasse and Mark will discuss how to solve this.

3. [**Retro**](https://dev.azure.com/merkleprojects/Installat%C3%B8rgruppen/_apps/hub/ms-devlabs.team-retrospectives.home#teamId=337e5fd6-9901-4066-96a6-2c794d4bb8b4&boardId=d2c8244b-0c2e-42d5-86a4-0cad100a1a87): I mentioned thatwe are evaluating if we can improve the retro, so we tried a different template today where we looked at what went well and what we can improve. I would appreciate if you share your option about the retro with me on teams. Send a short line if you would like to keep it or have it every other week or drop it alltogether in  DM please. Points to consider for this sprint:
- @<0EBA20A6-5B36-475E-9536-CC042704399F> and @<E0E22C7A-33CE-6C71-9635-81E759475108> will focus on refining and identifying AC for the tasks and aim at creating smaller PR's
- @<5D67D5D3-810C-4486-97ED-FFA97AC5334A> and @<0EBA20A6-5B36-475E-9536-CC042704399F> will discuss how we can keep track on the progress compared to the high level estimates that were done before fall break.
- Everyone is asked to give an update about their tasks in case they were blocked. Either in the stand up chat in teams or during the next stand up meeting

4. **Planning**:
- Lasse will provide the navigation so Jim can finalise the task from Sprint 4 #3064
- @<0EBA20A6-5B36-475E-9536-CC042704399F> will create the stories for Invoice control receipt page to make sure FE has the end point by Monday, 04.11. to reach the sprint goal.
